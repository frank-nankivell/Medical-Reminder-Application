# 5. Menu structure 

Date: 22.04.2019

## Status

Accepted

## Context

In order to complete the application a number of menu structures have been used rather than a single structure. These provide ensure the application enables direct  access to the locations of the pharmacies through the splash screen rather than having to go through the authentication screen. The back button on the location screen will be used to evaluate whether the user has a token and provide locked authentication through this mechansim.

## Decision
I will use a number of menu structures rather than a single react-stack-navigation.

## Consequences

The application will use a mixture of menu structures rather than a single structure.
MAIN, NAVIGATION, SPLASH AND LOCATION.
