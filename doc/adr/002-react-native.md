# 2. React Native

Date: 13.04.2019

## Status

Accepted

## Context
There are a number of tools and frameworks to use to build the application. These include the following list: Angular,Ionic,JQuery,Bootstrap,Zurb,JQuery Mobile,less/sass,React.js,Knockout.js and any other js/css based framework/library, Java Android Studiom, Xamarin for Visual Studio, XCode/Swift for IoS

Due to a lack of time there has not been enough opportunity to investigate each and every option - and therefore this decision could be amended after the initial MVP of the application has been built.

React Native provides a javascript library which therefore means IOS and Android development shares around 75% of the same application code. This therefore means the appliations is much easier to migrate between the most popular devices. Evidenced here: https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10125/50605/paper0718.pdf

 
## Decision

I will use react-native for the development for the application.

## Consequences

Use react-native as described here by facebook: https://facebook.github.io/react-native/
