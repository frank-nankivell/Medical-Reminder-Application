# 9. MAP Choice

Date: 22.04.2019

## Status

Accepted

## Context

There are a number of mapping components that could be used as part of the application, and render the local pharmacy data upon them. React is predominantly cross platform however there are some differences when using Mapping. Google maps can be complicated to use when on an IOS. This application has been tested and built through using the IOS framework and therefore the native EXPO MapView component is a signifanctly less bug heavy choice.

## Decision

To use EXPO MapView component for rendering the map due to IOS 
## Consequences

To use EXPO MapView component for rendering the map due to IOS
