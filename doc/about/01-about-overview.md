# What is the application? 

#### This application is a medical reminder app. It provides a way for users to create reminders to take their medication. Each reminder can then be marked as complete once it has been taken. The app also provides a pharmacy locator component providing users an easy way to locate nearby pharmacies in the event they need to buy replacement medication.


##Background Context 

The world has an ageing population, many of whom are required to take medication a number of times everyday due to their ill health. Throughout nations like the UK and the US there are increasing number of people forgetting to tak their medication, this application seeks to address this issue. Furthermore the application has been built with elderley users and their engagement with mobile devices in mind.

As set out in this paper by Lustig et al [see link] (https://www.pnas.org/content/100/24/14504.short) elderley user are much more likely to forget to take medication regularly. 

This is reinforced here [see link] (https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Reinhard_Lindner/publication/23485347_Adherence_to_medication_in_patients_with_dementia_predictors_and_strategies_for_improvement/links/09e414f980361ac216000000/Adherence-to-medication-in-patients-with-dementia-predictors-and-strategies-for-improvement.pdf) 

Therefore this means that this application does not only need to be user friendly for elderley people but also considerate of forgetful users requirements. 

As set out in this article 'Mental Models of a mobile phone'by Martina Ziefle and Susanne Bay, [See link to their article] (https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2Fb100594) older people have greater difficulty using mobile phones and navigating between menus. They are also additionally generally less performant at using mobile devices than younger users. 

Therefore to ensure users are able to understand the application effectively the app needs to be built with effective and clear navigation throughout.
